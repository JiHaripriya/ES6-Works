/*
Consider the below array
const  array = [1,2,3,1,4,10, 15, 16, 5, 12, 18, 19, 2, 20]
 Create a new array returning with multiples of 2, sorted in descending order and for every alternate multiple replace with a alphabet limited to 3 starting from “abc”, “def” [eg: [2,”ABC”,10, “DEF”.....]
What are all the possible the ways to empty the above array
The above array includes many repeating values, remove them using any ES6 method
Iterate the above array without mutating to check if the value 3 exist 

Analyse the below data representing the college students information

const students = [
 { name: "A", age: 17, college: "UVCE",stream:'CSE',currentYear:1 },
 { name: "B", age: 19, college: "KEAM",stream:'ECE',currentYear:2 },
 { name: "C", age: 23, college: "UVCE",stream:'EEE',currentYear:4 },
 { name: "D", age: 18, college: "UVCE",stream:'CSE',currentYear:3 },
 { name: "E", age: 22, college: "KEAM",stream:'AEI',currentYear:4 },
 { name: "F", age: 21, college: "NETE",stream:'EEE',currentYear:3 }
]

There is election voting for the post of Chairperson, for which only final year students are eligible. Create a list satisfying the above condition.
The student B seems to have the wrong college name in the above data. Return an above array with the college name replaced as “NETE”
Find the total number of students that would be eligible for placements this year.
Create an array with students with stream ‘EEE” and in the order of their currentYear
Create a new array for the students above the age of 21, add a new property ‘cgpa’ 










3. Analyse the below data 

const arr1 = [
{key : "1" , value: "abc"}, 
{key : "2" , value: "def"}, 
{key : "3" , value: "ghi"}, 
{key : "4" , value: "jkl"}
];
Return an reserved array with only the value for key 3 altered with value : “xyz”, maintaining the remaining key value pairs
Return an array containing only the values and append them to form a single word
From the above the obtained single word, extract the exact middle letter


4.Combine the below two objects and create an array with only the object keys
const obj1 = {a: 1 , b: 2} 
const obj2 = {c:3, d:4 , e:5}


5.
 
 let Obj ={
   name:"ABC",
   email:"abc@gmail.com",
   age:25,
   address:{
     city:"Tvpm",
     state:"Kerala",
     pinCode:12345
   }
  
 }
 

From the above, console the address values(using destructuring)
Write a function that prevent the above object from adding new properties but change its pinCode to 55555
